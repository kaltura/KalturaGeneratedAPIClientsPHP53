#PHP 5.3 auto generated clients libs which will then be built and test by Travis CI
####Please note that you should not make pull requests to the repo as the clientlibs are auto generated upon every Core release.
####Instead, please submit pulls to:

https://github.com/kaltura/clients-generator
code is under sources/php53

####Also, note that we have 2 additional PHP clients libs: sources/php5, sources/zend so your changes may be relevant to them too.
